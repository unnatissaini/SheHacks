        <h2>Why Weight Gain During Pregnancy is Important</h2>
        <p>When you’re expecting, some pregnancy weight gain is normal. To support your developing baby or babies, it’s important to maintain or adopt healthy habits, including a nutritious diet and regular exercise, under the guidance of your healthcare professional.

            Depending on your pre-pregnancy weight and body mass index (BMI)—an indicator of your body fat mass based on your weight and height—you may need to make certain lifestyle changes to support or slow weight gain for you and your child’s well-being.</p>

        <h2>How Much Weight Should You Gain?</h2>
        <p>Most women put on between 10kg (22lb) and 12.5kg (28lb) during their pregnancy.

Your healthy weight gain during pregnancy may depend on the weight you were before you got pregnant. There are no official guidelines in the UK but the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists say that:

<li>women who are underweight (BMI under 18.5) are recommended to put on between 28-40 lbs (13-18kg)</li>
<li>women in the normal weight range (BMI of 18.5-24.9) are recommended to put on between 25-35lbs (11-16kg)</li>
<li>women who are overweight (BMI between 25 and 29.9) are recommended to put on between 15-25lbs (7-11kg)</li>
<li>women who are affected by obesity (BMI of 30 or more), are recommended to put on between 11-20 lbs (5-9kg)</li>
The recommended weight gain for women expecting twins is:

women in the normal weight range (BMI of 18.5-24.9) are recommended to put on between 37-54 lbs (16.8-24.5kg)
women who are overweight (BMI between 25 and 29.9) are recommended to put on between 31-50 lbs (14.1-22.7kg)
women who are affected by obesity (BMI of 30 or more), are recommended to put on between 25-42 lbs (11.3-19.1kg).

Try not to get too concerned about these guidelines. The most important thing is to keep your weight gain to a safe and healthy level for you and your baby.

Your doctor or midwife will be able to advise and reassure you about what is right for you. If you are underweight or overweight, you should get extra care and support during your pregnancy.</li>

        <h2>Tips for Healthy Weight Gain During Pregnancy</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Ask your healthcare provider for advice. They can help you calculate your BMI, track weight gain throughout your pregnancy, and suggest lifestyle changes that suit your specific needs. 
            Eat well. As you add more calories to your diet, stock up on nutrient-packed foods such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains like oatmeal and quinoa, yogurt, nuts, and lean proteins like chicken and turkey breast.
            To slow weight gain, opt for reduced-fat dairy, swap sugary beverages for water, eat out less often, and make your portion sizes a little smaller.
            To gain more weight, add healthy fats and snacks to your diet such as olive oil, nut butter with whole grain crackers, nuts, dried fruit, and avocados.
            Combat nausea with mini-meals. To ensure you and your child are getting the nutrients you need despite morning sickness, try to eat small, nutrient-dense meals every couple of hours.
            Get active. With your healthcare professional’s okay, aim for or work up to 150 minutes of physical activity each week or about 30 minutes per day. 
            Avoid contact sports and go for exercises you’re comfortable with such as a moderate-intensity version of your usual workout, walking, or swimming. During sweat sessions, take plenty of breaks and stay hydrated.</li>
          <li>Provide some advice on exercise, nutrition, and self-care during pregnancy.</li>
